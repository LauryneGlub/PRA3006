This is the project 11 :"Connecting the Dots: Mapping Gene Interactions in the Liver Steatosis Adverse Outcome Pathway Network" by XiangRu Huang and Lauryne Zacharia

# Description
The regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver encompasses multiple pathways and various key components. We try to provide the visualization of gene interactions within pathways that significantly regulate liver lipid synthesis, potentially contributing to the steatosis. 

This gene interaction visualization includes the Angiopoietin-like protein 8 regulatory pathway (WP3915), involved in the activation of ChREBP, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling (WP1403), and Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) signaling (WP1982), which activate SREBP-1c. These pathways were selected due to the crucial roles of ChREBP and SREBP-1c in lipid synthesis, suggesting their potential impact on liver lipid regulation and the development of liver steatosis [1].
