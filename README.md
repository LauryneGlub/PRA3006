This is the project 11 :"Connecting the Dots: Mapping Gene Interactions in the Liver Steatosis Adverse Outcome Pathway Network" by XiangRu Huang and Lauryne Zacharia

## Description
The regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver encompasses multiple pathways and various key components. We aim to provide a visualization of gene interactions within pathways that significantly regulate liver lipid synthesis, potentially contributing to steatosis.

This gene interaction visualization includes the Angiopoietin-like protein 8 regulatory pathway (WP3915), involved in the activation of ChREBP, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling (WP1403), and Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) signaling (WP1982), which activate SREBP-1c[^1]. These pathways were selected due to the crucial roles of ChREBP and SREBP-1c in lipid synthesis, suggesting their potential impact on liver lipid regulation and the development of liver steatosis[^2].
