This is the project 11 :"Connecting the Dots: Mapping Gene Interactions in the Liver Steatosis Adverse Outcome Pathway Network" by XiangRu Huang and Lauryne Zacharia

# Description
The regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver encompasses multiple pathways and various key components. We aim to provide a visualization of gene interactions within pathways that significantly regulate liver lipid synthesis, potentially contributing to steatosis.

This gene interaction visualization includes the Angiopoietin-like protein 8 regulatory pathway [WP3915](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP3915.html){:target="_blank"}, involved in the activation of ChREBP, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling [WP1403](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP1403.html){:target="_blank"}, and Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) signaling [WP1982](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP1982.html){:target="_blank"}, which activate SREBP-1c. These pathways were selected due to the crucial roles of ChREBP and SREBP-1c in lipid synthesis, suggesting their potential impact on liver lipid regulation and the development of liver steatosis [^1].
